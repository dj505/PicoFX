# 3D Printable Parts

## Body
This is required for all current builds. If you're experienced with 3D printing you can ignore the following recommended settings and use your own. I trust you :)  
Be sure to use translucent or transparent filament for the underglow lighting!  
Recommended settings for beginners (aka, the ones I used):  
* Infill: 25-30%
* Infill pattern: cubic
* Build plate adhesion: skirt
* Wall count: 2 minimum

## Plate
This part is **not required** if you're using a second PCB as the plate (which would be recommended, as it's stronger and more functional). If you're **handwiring** a PicoFX without a PCB, this can also be used for that. You're going to need to figure out how to mount the test/service buttons yourself though, as this isn't method won't be officially documented.  
Use any type of filament for this step. SVG file for laser cutting is also available - a fully transparent plate would let you see the PCB silkscreen art! How cool would that be?  
Recommended settings for beginners (aka, the ones I used):  
* Infill: 80-100%
* Infill pattern: cubic
* Build plate adhesion: skirt
* Wall count: 2 minimum

## SVG files
These are provided in case you want to design and/or laser cut your own case. Feel free to modify and share freely!  
* Case Footprint:
    * Basic outline of the perimiter of the case, with screw holes.
* Plate:
    * Outline of the plate, with holes for Cherry MX compatible switches and screw holes.
